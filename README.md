# Project-3-Module-8 

Project Summary

The Corner Grocer program was built to help a grocery store track how often each item is purchased during the day. The program reads data from a text file that lists all the items sold and counts how many times each item appears. The goal is to show what products sell the most so the store can organize its layout better and restock more effectively.

What I Did Well

I did a good job breaking the program into smaller parts so it was easier to read and understand. The code runs smoothly, and the logic for reading the file and counting each item works the way it should. The menu also makes it simple for users to look up items or view the full list.

Areas for Improvement

I could improve the program by adding more input checks and handling bad data better. I’d also like to format the output so it’s cleaner and easier to follow. If I had more time, I’d work on optimizing the file-reading process and make the code more secure against unexpected input. These changes would make it more professional and reliable.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them

One of the hardest parts was getting the program to correctly read and process the text file. Sometimes the file path or format caused issues, so I had to test different ways of opening and reading it. I used online C++ references, my course materials, and examples from class to fix the bugs. Once I figured out how to loop through the file line by line, everything started working better.

Transferable Skills

This project helped me practice file input and output, loops, data storage with maps or arrays, and problem-solving through debugging. Those are skills I can use in almost any programming language or project. I also learned how to write clearer code that can be reused or improved later.

Making the Code Maintainable and Readable

I used clear comments, named variables that make sense, and kept each function focused on one job. This makes the code easier to understand for anyone who looks at it later, including me. The structure is simple enough that if someone wanted to add new features, like exporting data to a CSV or making a better menu, they could do it easily.
